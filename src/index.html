        <p>The term planet is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, 
            science, mythology, and religion. Apart from Earth itself, 
            five planets in the Solar System are often visible to the naked eye. 
            These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, 
            or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, 
            human perception of the planets changed, incorporating
             a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International 
             Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution 
             defining planets within the Solar System.

             <br>
             This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects 
             of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. 
             Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 
             950 remain "planets" under the current definition, 
             some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, 
             Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), 
             and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), 
             that were once considered planets by the scientific community, 
             are no longer viewed as planets under the current definition of planet.
